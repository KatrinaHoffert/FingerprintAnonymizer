#FingerprintAnonymizer

A Chrome extension for removing identifying information to reduce or prevent browser fingerprinting.

##Installation
UPDATE 2014-08-17: Chrome no longer allows local extensions to be installed on Windows machines. You'll have to jump through some hoops install this. You shouldn't intall it, anyway. It was experimental and development ended once it served its purpose. It has a handful of issues on some sites.

For development:

1. Go to `chrome://extensions`
2. Ensure the developer mode checkbox in the top right corner is checked
3. Click the "load unpacked extension" button
4. Choose the folder that contains this repo

When you make changes to the extension, load your changes by clicking the reload link on the extension on the `chrome://extensions` page.
