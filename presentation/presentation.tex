% Importance of IA
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Internet anonymity is important}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Supports freedom of speech: governments can't censor you if they don't know who you are
		\item Skirting surveillance generally requires anonymity (perhaps to avoid government censorship)
		\item Oppressive governments often attempt censorship
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Turkey recently blocked Twitter
			\item Amnesty International stated that China ``has the largest recorded number of imprisoned journalists and cyber-dissidents in the world''
			\item In Iran, internet users must promise not to access ``non-Islamic'' websites
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Internet anonymity is important}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Whistleblowers may need anonymity to prevent retaliation
		\item Undercover military and law enforcement agents often need anonymity for their protection
		\item Journalists may have to protect their sources
		\item One line of defence against targeted attacks
		\item Removes real life consequences for controversial opinions
		\item Some people feel uncomfortable speaking publicly
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Threats to IA
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Threats to internet anonymity}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item IP addresses can be tied to an ISP customer (but insufficient to identify a specific individual)
		\begin{itemize}
			\item There could be another person using the computer
			\item Drive by downloading
		\end{itemize}
		\item A number of recent American actions would have implications on internet anonymity: SOPA, PIPA, PRISM, CISPA, etc
		\item ISPs that sell your information
		\item Tracking services (especially with online advertisers)
		\item Browsers have lots of identifying information -- \textbf{this is what our project focused on}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Browser fingerprint
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Browser fingerprint}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A browser fingerprint is a way to identify a specific browser, based an unique identifiers that is holds
		\item Some features include things like:
		% I removed cookies from here because they're so useless at fingerprinting - Mike
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Header Information
			\item Installed Plugins
			\item Installed Fonts
			\item Time Zone
			\item Screen Size
			\item User Agent
		\end{itemize}
		\item If you combine these features of a browser together, you will find that every browser tends to have a very unique set of these properties. This is your ``Browser Fingerprint''
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Panopticlick
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Panopticlick}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The tool used to gauge the effectiveness of our changes was the EFF's Panopticlick research project
		\item Panopticlick $<$\textcolor{gray}{https://panopticlick.eff.org/}$>$ is an attempt to identify the uniqueness of a browser via some of the previously mentioned techniques
		\item We picked the most identifying techniques and attempted to thwart them
		\item The goal was to make the browser as difficult to fingerprint as possible
		\item Let's go into more detail on how we did that
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% HTTP headers
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{HTTP Headers}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The fields in your HTTP headers can be used to help to detect your browser fingerprint.
		\item The header field User-Agent contains identifying information regarding your operating system and version, as well what browser you're using and what version it is.
		\item The Language-Accept field can also pass identifying information regarding language settings. For instance, your browser might be passing en-CA (Canadian English) as your preferred language.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{HTTP Headers: Our Solution}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our solution to this problem was to look at modifying the header fields before they are sent.
		\item For instance, in setting the Language-Accept field to accept just the more generic US english instead of trying to accept Canadian english (much less common).
		\item Consider that with our language preference set to Canadian English, roughly \textbf{1 in 220,000} browsers have this value. In passing en-US instead, \textbf{1 in 40} browsers have this value. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Available fonts
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Available fonts}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Browser fonts can be incredibly identifying because many users have a somewhat unique set of fonts (often installed by other applications)
		\item Clever and varying techniques using Javascript can be used to accomplish this
		\item Primary method we tried to break was measuring font width/height
		\item 2 Approaches to the problem:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item Override the specific functions that measure fonts
				\item Override or block common DOM methods used when measuring fonts
			\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Available fonts}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Problems arise with page load times and overriding DOM methods
		\item In the case of panopticlick, Java and Flash were used to try and detect fonts (much easier and faster when fonts can be enumerated rather than having to check the existence from a very large list)
		\item Thus, the use of Flashblock and preventing Java applets from running is the most useful approach against sites that use installed fonts for fingerprinting
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Available plugins
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Available plugins}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Browsers use plugins to extend functionality
		\item Aside from font detection, plugins are the largest source for fingerprints
		\item Browsers store information about the plugins in an array that is accessible to outside scripts
		\item Enumerating this array is useful for fingerprinting
		\item These plugins can also be specifically targeted by name and version if need be (i.e. `Silverlight Plug-In', `Quicktime Plug-in 7.73')
		\item Thwarted by injecting a script that removes access to the plugins array
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Other fingerprinting threats
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Other fingerprinting threats}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Flash is an effective and very common method to detect fonts (and possibly other information about the system)
		\item Preventable by changing settings in Flash
		\begin{itemize}
			\item[] File: \texttt{mms.cfg} \\ Line: \texttt{DisableDeviceFontEnumeration = 1}
		\end{itemize}
		\item To prevent these, there are extension like Flashblock
		\item Fingerprinting can be combined with the approximate geographical location that an IP address tells us. This is not an accurate location, but neither are other fingerprinting techniques -- it's the combination that makes for accuracy
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Putting it all together
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Putting it all together}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Our Chrome plugin, named ``Fingerprint Anonymizer'', adds several hooks and overrides to prevent or reduce fingerprinting
		\item The goal was not to flat out block actions that could be used to identify the user, but rather to let the user know that they were taking place and allow them to choose whether or not to allow them
		\item This goal was ultimately not possible, due to the fact that much of the data was accessed through parameters and not functions -- we couldn't add functionality to detect when information was read
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Putting it all together}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A whitelist was implemented, which the user could add domains for which the blocking is not activated
		\item The user can manually add domains to the whitelist in the extension's options page
		\item We also implemented a browser action (a button in the browser's main toolbar that opens a prompt) to add the current domain to the whitelist
		\item Rewriting the HTTP headers is done for all pages
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Results}

% Drawbacks
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Drawbacks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Fingerprinting is not accurate
		\begin{itemize}
			\item It tracks machines, not individuals
			\item Some information, such as browser user agents, can change very frequently
			\item Browsers are beginning to implement features to prevent mass gathering of information
			\item Firefox, for example, no longer allows enumeration of plugins (but you can still detect individual plugins)
		\end{itemize}
		\item Many JavaScript properties are accessed as parameters rather than by functions
		\item This is a shortfall of the language, which does not provide control over visibility
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Drawbacks
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Drawbacks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Thus, while we could block access to a parameter, we could not change the behavior of accessing the parameter
		\item Our original goal was to alert the user when a page appears to be collecting too much information
		\item We could only silently thwart the fingerprinting page -- they get nothing (but neither do legitimate pages)
		\item Chrome sandboxes extensions. In order to modify JS variables, we had to make our injected content script further inject code into the page's Document Object Model (DOM)
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Conclusion
\begin{frame}[fragile,t]{Conclusion}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Browser fingerprinting has potential of tracking browsers based on their discernible features
		\item Features that are largely unique are much more trackable
		\item Preventing enumeration of these features is the best defence against fingerprinting
		\item Due to limitations of the JavaScript language and browser extension capabilities, preventing enumeration would be better done by the browser
		\item Preventing detection of fonts and plugins hinders legitimate sites -- better to prevent mass detection
	\end{itemize}
